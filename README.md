 web app that was created specifically for Sunshine (aka Alona). This app calculates work hours and shows your salary at the end of the month. It allows you
 to input your hourly wage and the number of hours you worked each day. The app would then
 calculate the total earnings for the month, and display the amount and the calculating process. You could also view the
 work hours for each day and, potentially have the option to edit or delete entries.
 Please note that the app dose not sync with the Hebrew calendar, so make sure to mark your holidays accordingly (with absence).
